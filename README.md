# Personal Maths Libraries
A collection of maths libraries that I have coded up to help me learn some new languages, some of them might potentially come in useful for something I do not know?

## To do
- Better error checking and bounds handling in "polymath.c"
- Actual functionality for polynomials, functions such as addition, scalar multiplcation etc
- Enforcement of modulus property
- Complex number library
- Ability to pretty-print polynomials with their variable
